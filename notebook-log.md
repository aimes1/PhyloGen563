* Uploaded datasets to data folder
  * 2024_Vfischeri_genbankref_files folder contains reference *V. fischeri* genomes downloaded from Genbank. 3 strains were downloaded (ES114, MJ11, and SR5) with a minimum of chromosome 1 and chromosome 2 of the genome assembled. 
  * 2024_Vfischeri_MillerAssemblies folder contains the flye assemblies for 12 *V. fischeri* strains used in the squid-vibrio model system for the traditional squid host *Euprymna scolopes* as downloaded on 2024-02-12. The quality control and processing for these assemblies is detailed in the [data/ReadME.md](data/README.md) file. 
  * 2022_Eberryi_WGSeq_consensusfnas folder contains nanopore whole genome sequencing fasta files for 11 bacterial isolates processed by me from *Euprymna berryi* squid sources in 2022. Plasmidsaurus processing is detailed in the [data/ReadME.md](data/README.md) file. 
* Notes on data upload 
  * The 2022 E. berryi isolate sequences are highly fragmented and unable to circularize as chromosomes. I aim to resequence these bacterial isolates within the month and reprocess the raw reads to generate higher quality genomic data. 
  * The 2024 Miller assemblies are in triplicate at the moment, to be further processed in TriCycler to synthesize the three assemblies for each strain.
