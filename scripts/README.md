### Distance & Parsimony Homework
Script information contained in [distance_parsimony_HW.md](scripts/distance_parsimony_HW.md). 

Instructions: 
1. Estimate a distance-based tree and a parsimony-based tree for bacterial isolate data using the `ape` and `phangorn` R packages.
  - Don't forget to include in your reproducible script a short description of the chosen algorithm, its assumptions and limitations (see the [software cheatsheet](https://github.com/crsl4/phylogenetics-class/blob/master/exercises/software-cheatsheet.md))
2. Make sure to keep notes in your reproducible script and keep the most updated version on github (it is important to push your work to github since this allows me to check what you are doing and offer suggestions)
3. Submit the link to the github commit in canvas
4. Note: I tried to provide the programs the berryiisolatesall.xmfa from the Mauve alignment, but this generated an error and did not run to completion. I'm still troubleshooting the use of MUSCLE and ClustalW to generate an alignment, so the hypothetical entry of my own data is detailed in the file. 

### Maximum Likelihood Homework
Script information contained in [maximum_likelihood_HW.md](scripts/maximum_likelihood_HW.md). 

Instructions:
1. Choose a maximum likelihood method that you like the best on your project dataset (it does not have to be RAxML or IQ-Tree, but you should read the paper and tutorial of whichever method you choose)
   1. Don't forget to include in your reproducible script a short description of the chosen algorithm, its assumptions and limitations (see the software cheatsheet Links to an external site.)
2. Make sure to keep notes in your reproducible script and keep the most updated version on github (it is important to push your work to github since this allows me to check what you are doing and offer suggestions)
3. Submit the link to your github commit in canvas
